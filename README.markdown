WineDB
======

WineDB is an open-source Android application that helps you manage your
personal database of wines. This is made primarily for people who have bad
memory (like myself), enjoy wine but often forget what wines taste good.

This application depends on having a camera good enough to scan barcodes, as
well as Google's ZXing application. WineDB will prompt the user to download it
if it's not already present on the system.
